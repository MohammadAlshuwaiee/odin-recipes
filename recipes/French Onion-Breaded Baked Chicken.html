            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

           <li>
            Mix bread crumbs and dry soup mix together in a bowl.

            Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.

            Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
