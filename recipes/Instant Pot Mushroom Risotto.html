Creamy risotto with softened mushrooms and a sprinkling of cheese seems like a dish best ordered at a
 restaurant instead of made at home. That's because traditionally risotto is made slowly, stirring often,
 adding 1/4 cup of hot stock at a time, then more stirring. It's a labor-intensive dish that's worth the fuss. 
 However, risotto made in a pressure cooker is so simple and quick that it feels like cheating. It's not. This is the real stuff. You'll probably start making risotto far more often after you try this one.
